✅ Project Description

The Online Book Store SQL Project is a relational database analysis built using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.
The project contains three CSV datasets — Books, Customers, and Orders — representing an online bookstore’s operations.
The goal of the project is to build the database structure, import all datasets, perform SQL queries, and extract meaningful business insights such as best-selling genres, customer behavior, revenue trends, and inventory status.

✅ Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world online bookstore and focuses on analyzing:

Customer locations and purchase behavior

Book inventory levels and genre distribution

Total revenue generated

Most sold books and most valuable customers

Remaining stock after fulfilling all orders

The project uses SQL to perform both basic and advanced data analysis, including joins, grouping, aggregations, filtering, subqueries, and analytical queries.

✅ Tools and Technologies Used

PostgreSQL – Relational database management system

pgAdmin 4 – GUI tool for managing PostgreSQL databases

SQL – For data querying and analysis

CSV Files – Raw data input for database tables

Git & GitHub – Version control and project hosting

✅ Steps Performed
1. Data Preparation

Reviewed the three CSV files: Books, Customers, Orders

Cleaned and standardized the date column in the Orders dataset

Ensured all columns matched correct data types before importing

2. Database Creation

Created a new PostgreSQL database named online_book_store

Created tables: Books, Customers, and Orders

Defined primary keys and foreign key relationships

3. Data Import

Imported each CSV file into its respective table using pgAdmin

Validated row counts and checked for import errors

4. SQL Query Execution

Executed basic and advanced SQL queries to analyze:

Genres

Customer demographics

Stock availability

Orders placed in specific time periods

Revenue calculations

Best-selling authors and genres

Customer spending

5. Result Interpretation

Compared stock with quantity sold

Identified top customers, most expensive books, and ordering patterns

Calculated remaining stock after sales

6. GitHub Project Setup

Created README documentation

Structured project folder

Uploaded CSV files and SQL queries

✅ SQL Analysis Highlights

Identified all books belonging to the Fiction genre

Found books published after 1950

Listed customers from Canada

Filtered orders placed in November 2023

Calculated the total stock and total revenue

Found the most expensive book

Determined the most frequently ordered book

Analyzed books sold per genre

Found top 3 expensive Fantasy books

Calculated quantity sold by each author

Computed remaining stock after fulfilling all orders

Identified customers who placed multiple orders

Found customer who spent the most overall
